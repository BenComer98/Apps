This is a coding project, my first in React after completing much of the React course in Udemy.

My goals for this project are:
- Design my own blueprint of an app
- Manage different components using context and props
- Get this on a server

NOTE: This will not work via GitHub until I figure out how to get this on the server and set up remote querying from personalized credentials (probably SessionKeys)
